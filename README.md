# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, relationships, and insights using Python and key data science libraries.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

---

## 🗃️ Dataset
- Dataset used: `train.csv` from the Titanic survival prediction dataset.
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### ✅ Basic Exploration
- Dataset structure, missing values, data types, summary statistics

### ✅ Univariate Analysis
- Age distribution (histogram)
- Fare outliers (boxplot)

### ✅ Bivariate Analysis
- Age vs Fare (scatterplot)
- Survival by Age (barplot)

### ✅ Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation heatmap between numeric features
- Pairplot showing Age, Fare, and Survival

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Most passengers were aged between 20–40 years.
- Outliers were found in the Fare column (very high values).
- Passengers who paid higher fares tended to survive more often.
- Female passengers had higher survival rates.
- Strong correlation between class (`Pclass`) and fare.
